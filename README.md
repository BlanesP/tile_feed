Tech project to test various iOS frameworks. Mainly focused on:

- Making API requests with Alamofire and caching data with CoreData
- Wrapping all that in Combine and Clean Architecture.
- Building a killer UI with MVVM and SwiftUI
- *Ongoing: Making sure that nothing is broken with Unit Testing*

I am also working on [this other project](https://github.com/BlanesP/simple_investment_tracker) which I published to the app store.
